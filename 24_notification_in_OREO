Notification in Android 8.0(oreo): 
•	Android 8.0 Oreo comes with notification Dots. With Notification Dots, whenever you have any notification to be checked, you will see
a dot on the icon of that particular app which is having the unchecked notification. 

•	With OREO we can separate your app’s notifications into notification channels. 

•	All notifications that are posted to the same channel have the same behaviour, for example we could create a channel for our app’s most 
urgent notifications, where each notification is announced with an alert sound, vibration and a notification light, and then create 
“quieter” channels for the rest of your app’s notifications. 

•	Android Oreo also gives users more control over notifications than ever before, as in Android 8.0 users can modify the settings for 
any notification channel that’s present on their device.

•	In OREO, they have redesigned notifications to provide an easier and more consistent way to manage notification behavior and settings. 
Some of these changes include:

Notification channels: Android 8.0 introduces notification channels that allow you to create a user-customizable channel for each type 
of notification you want to display.

Notification dots: Android 8.0 introduces support for displaying dots, or badges, on app launcher icons. Notification dots reflect the 
presence of notifications that the user has not yet dismissed or acted on.

Snoozing: Users can snooze notifications, which causes them to disappear for a period of time before reappearing. Notifications reappear
with the same level of importance they first appeared with.

Messaging style: In Android 8.0, notifications that use the MessagingStyle class display more content in their collapsed form. 
You should use theMessagingStyle class for notifications that are messaging-related.
