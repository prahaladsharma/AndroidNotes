Intent - is a message passing mechanism between components of android, except for Content Provider. You can use intent to start any component.
Sticky Intent - Sticks with android, for future broad cast listeners. For example if BATTERY_LOW event occurs then that intent will be stick with android so that if any future user requested for BATTER_LOW, it will be fired. Intent your are sending stays around after the broadcast is complete, so that others can quickly retrieve that data through the return value of registerReceiver(BroadcastReceiver, IntentFilter). 
Sticky Intent is also a type of Intent which allows a communication between function and a service sendStickyBroadcast() performs a sendBroadcast(Inent) know as sticky, It lets us pass a future Intent to another application and allow that application to execute that Intent as if it had the same permissions as our application
Pending Intent - If you want some one to perform any Intent operation at future point of time on behalf of you, then we will use Pending Intent.
