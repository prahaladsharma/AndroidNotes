Multi-Threading In Android:
Multi-Threading in Android is a unique feature through which more than one threads execute together without hindering the execution of other threads. Multi-Threading in Android is not different from conventional multi-Threading. 
A class can be thought of as a process having its method as itâ€™s sub-processes or threads. All these methods can run concurrently by using feature of Multi-Threading. In android, multi-Threading can be achieved through the use of many in-built classes. Out of them, Handler class is most commonly used.
Handler class in Android:
Handler class come from the Package android.os.Handler package and is most commonly used for multi-threading in android. Handler class provide sending and receiving feature for messages between different threads and handle the thread execution which is associated with that instance of Handler class.
In android class, every thread is associated with an instance of Handler class and it allows the thread to run along with other threads and communicate with them through messages.
Instantiating Handler class:
There are following two ways in which Handler class is usually instantiated for supporting multi-threading:
1. Through default constructor. 
Handler handlerObject = new Handler();
2. Through Parameterized constructor
Handler handleObject = new Handler(Runnable runnableObject, Handler.Callback callbackObject);
